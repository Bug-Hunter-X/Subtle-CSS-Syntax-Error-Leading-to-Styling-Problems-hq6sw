This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked CSS bug: a subtle syntax error that causes unexpected styling issues.  The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.  The problem lies in how the CSS selectors and property values interact, leading to either no styling applied or unexpected visual results. The solution involves carefully reviewing the syntax, ensuring all properties are properly valued and that selectors are valid and target the correct elements.  This example is meant to illustrate the importance of attention to detail when writing CSS code, as small mistakes can significantly affect the appearance of a web page.
