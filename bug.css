The CSS code has a syntax error that prevents the browser from parsing the stylesheet correctly.  The error might be subtle, such as a missing semicolon or incorrect property value. This leads to unexpected styling or no styling at all.  Another potential problem involves using an invalid selector that doesn't target any elements, rendering the CSS rule ineffective.
